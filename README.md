# Port scanner.

Here a simple port scanner made in Python.
The script is starting to be really slow when a port is closed and it's because of the timeout.
Actually, I didn't made it for use it but only for exploiting the socket library.

You can make it way more faster by doing an iterable with threads (only with ports range).
